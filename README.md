# pweb
simple, light perl based webserver-  

You only need to download pweb, adjust perl path, chmod 544 and run.....
Other directories and files will be generated as long as the user who is running pweb (should't be root)
has the appropriate permisssions.
Used for mainly for admin of remote systems.  More core components will be added. For now only
access to  http://localhost:10000 for get requests to the html directory, or allow CGIs to execute.
filetail tool is builtin - go to http://localhost:10000/filetail
